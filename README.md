WUNDERWAFFEL

Let me introduce to you a wunderfull project which makes every waffel entusiast dreams come true.

The application contains the most beautiful form that you have ever seen.
IN TWO VERSIONS.

I wasn't capable of deciding which design appeal to my clients, so I created them both
- single site form devided into steps with the collapsaple widget from Bootstrap
- form divided into separte steps with deadicated view for each. Just as in the specification (the ugly truth is that it also uses single view, but uses js to pretend that it is not)

There is a AB tests which will choose the winner. 
To see both form please use incognito mode or kill your session and refresh the page.

Additionaly I added an admin page when authenticated user can managed register clients, and see current result of AB test.
